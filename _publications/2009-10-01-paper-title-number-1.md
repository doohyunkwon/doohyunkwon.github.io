Computational design of molecular homogeneous organometallic catalysts followed by experimental realization remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the development and use of a density functional theory transition-state model that provided quantitative prediction of molecular Cr catalysts for controllable selective ethylene trimerization and tetramerization. This computational model identified a general class of phosphine monocyclic imine (P,N)-ligand Cr catalysts where changes in the ligand structure control 1-hexene versus 1-octene selectivity. Experimental ligand and catalyst synthesis as well as reaction testing quantitatively confirmed predictions..
